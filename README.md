# Censoring Simulation with RShiny

This repository brings together the final paper (TCC) focused on Survival Analysis, with the implementation of an interactive application developed in **RShiny**.

## About the Project

Survival Analysis is a field of statistics dedicated to the study of the time until the occurrence of an event of interest. This project aims to facilitate understanding of the application of the concept of Censorship through an intuitive graphical interface.

## Features

- Upload and analysis of custom datasets
- Estimation of survival curves (Kaplan-Meier)
- Interactive visualization tools
- Export of results and graphs

## Technologies Used

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
- [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
