# Censoring Simulation with RShiny

This repository is my final paper (TCC in Brazil) focused on the impact of the censoring in the comparing of curves, with the implementation of an interactive application developed in **RShiny**.

## About the Project

Survival Analysis is a field of statistics dedicated to the study of the time until the occurrence of not of an event of interest. This project aims to facilitate understanding of the application of the concept of Censorship through an intuitive graphical interface.

## Features

- Estimation of survival curves (Kaplan-Meier)
- Reverse Kaplan-Meier
- Interactive visualization tools
- Export of results and graphs
